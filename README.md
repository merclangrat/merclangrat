## Hello!

My name is Eugene, I use this Github mostly for retro computer projects.  
Not so much here, but something's in progress.

[My (a kind of) website](http://elming.org) - in progress, there will be more about retro computers soon.

## And if you'd like to hire me:

I am a systems engineer with a strong interest in stable, long-term infrastructure – especially BSD systems, Linux in classic systems administration contexts (not just cloud orchestration), illumos, Solaris, and other deep UNIX technologies.

Ideal roles include backend operations, infrastructure support, SRE on legacy or non-cloud-native systems, reproducible builds, or digital preservation work.

I only consider remote positions in non-fast-paced environments where quality and deep understanding are valued over speed. I do not consider relocation (remote work makes that unnecessary).

**I work in English only and do not speak German** (and don’t plan to, please don’t ask). Based in Berlin, available no earlier than 10 am CET.

While I understand the need for occasional incidents, I prefer roles without frequent or unpredictable on-call rotations. Systems that regularly wake engineers at night often indicate deeper architectural or process issues — I prefer helping prevent those rather than firefighting them.

Hobbies include retrocomputing, operating system internals, and designing long-term maintainable systems.

I don’t use Mac OS X — please don’t ask me to troubleshoot it or expect me to use it for work.

Open to full-time positions (no freelance or short-term contracts) with asynchronous communication and a long-term outlook.

Then, please contact me by [email](mailto:mercurius@elming.org).
