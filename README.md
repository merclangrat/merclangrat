## Hello!

My name is Eugene, I use this Github mostly for retro computer projects.  
Not so much here, but something's in progress.

[My (a kind of) website](http://elming.org) - in progress, there will be more about retro computers soon.

## And if you'd like to hire me:

I am a systems engineer with a strong interest in stable, long-term infrastructure – especially non-mainstream operating systems such as illumos, Solaris, \*BSD, and other deep UNIX technologies.

I only consider remote positions in non-fast-paced environments where quality and deep understanding are valued over speed. I do not consider relocation for work (anyway, it doesn't make sense for remote work to relocate).

**I work in English only and do not speak German** (and don’t plan to, please don’t ask). I am based in Berlin for now and cannot start earlier than 10am CET.

Ideal roles include: backend operations, infrastructure support, SRE on legacy or non-cloud-native systems, reproducible builds, or digital preservation work.

While I understand the need for occasional incidents, I prefer roles without frequent or unpredictable on-call rotations. Systems that regularly wake engineers at night often indicate deeper architectural or process issues, and I prefer helping to prevent those rather than firefighting them.

My hobbies include retrocomputing, operating system internals, and designing long-term maintainable systems. 

*I don’t use Mac OS X — please don’t ask me to troubleshoot it and don't suggest me a laptop with it for work.*

Open to full-time positions (no freelance and no time-limited contracts) with asynchronous communication and a long-term outlook.

Then, please contact me by [email](mailto:mercurius@elming.org).
